Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)
Results:    
    The purpose of this analysis is building multiple machine learning models to predict credit risk. This machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions reduce at risk cases, look over portforlios and fraud. 





There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)
Summary:
    N/A




There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification 
        Recommendations this model can use is the easy ensemble adaboost classifier. This has high performance for the measuring imbalanced classes. Being said, this model has the highest balance accuracy score and will work perfectly with the model and will give a correct forecast in Python.
